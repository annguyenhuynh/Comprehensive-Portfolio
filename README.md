# Comprehensive Portfolio
This portfolio comprises the four projects a business/data analyst needs to have - data cleansing and transforming, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and modeling.
1. Data Cleasing
* The data used in this project is data science job postings with 14 variables and 672 observations. The very first step is to load    data using pandas. This project is completed with instructions.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* There are two versions of this project. One version is completed in Rmarkdown and the other is in Python. This project was a         class project for my Data Mining summer class at GMU. The purpose of this project is to find out reasons why an employee leave a     company, and what managers can do to reduce employee attrition rate. This project focus mainly on examining multiple factors         through summary tables and charts/graphs with no modeling involved.

3. Data visualization
   * The first dashboard built in Power Bi explores salary of data scientists around the globe based on several elements such as          positions, experience, company size, company location, etc.
   * The second dashboard is also built in Power BI. For this data visualization project, I first did some analysis in MS SQL Server     Management Studio and connect the database to Power BI. This dashboard reflects the hotel performance industry before and during     the Covid 19 pandemic.

4. Data modeling
   * There are two versions of this project built in R and Python. They are all supervised machine learning models, the model built       in R is used for binary classification purpose and the one built in Python is used predict numerical values.
   * The three classification models in R are - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Linear Discriminant Analysis
   * The three models in Python are - Linear Regression, Random Forest, and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
